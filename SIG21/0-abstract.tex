\begin{abstract}
Writing papers and managing projects are essential for conducting research.
A research paper describes the final outcomes, but can also help manage intermediate progress.
This document provides a template for writing papers and describes how to manage projects via drafts.

Start the abstract when you have some rough ideas, before they are forgotten amid your busy lives.
It does not need to be fancy, as long as you can understand your own writing later.
The eventual abstract should be the minimalist version of the entire paper, with key information outlined in the introduction.
