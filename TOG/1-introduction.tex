Started from remote desktops and online videos, cloud-based computing has show unprecedented potential to reshape computer graphics pipeline by completely relieving end-user's computational workload thus device bulkiness. In recent years, we have observed growing interactive streaming services such as Google Stadia or NVIDIA Shield. 
However, these off-the-shelf services have only been deployed in less latency sensitive platforms such as TV-based game consoles, due to the inevitable latency (more than 100ms \footnote{\url{https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-how-stadias-input-lag-compares-to-native-pc-gaming/}}. Immersive medias, such as virtual and augmented realities, demand remarkably lower latency and higher fidelity/speed for sickness-free and natural experience. Due to the consequently massive spatial-temporal data volume, there is no solution for streaming frames from server to individual end users today.

This document provides a template for writing research papers, and describes how to manage project progress via iterating drafts.
Doing this correctly can help you achieve productive research and happy life, e.g. working anywhere anytime without synchronous meetings with your collaborators.

Our main idea, giving people a take home message and (if possible) see how clever we are.

I learned from my PhD adviser to start writing from the moment I have the faintest idea, and gradually update the drafts to reflect progress.
During my first job with NVIDIA, I learned why and how revision control is essential for sharing and editing source files, especially among large engineering teams.
The iterative nature of writing and coding matches well with the capability of revision control.
Thus I prefer Latex + git/svn (e.g. github, bitbucket, and the svn server under my hosting service), even though I can still manage with MS Word + cloud drive (e.g. Google drive, Box, and Dropbox). 
A good computer scientist writes papers like programs, and manages Latex files like source codes.
These repos are external memories and communication mediums for the collective brains of my teams.

\input{example_fig}

Translating thoughts into words, diagrams, equations, pseudo-codes, or codes is a good way to clarify and consolidate.
If you are writing a graphics/HCI paper, design the figures so that they alone can provide a high level picture of the main points.
As exemplified in \Cref{fig:example}, a figure can contain images, drawings, or combinations.

You can use the associated files as a starting template for your research papers.
Start with the \filename{Makefile}, and notice the two build targets: final for official submission and public disclosure, and draft for internal sharing among your collaborators (including yourself).
